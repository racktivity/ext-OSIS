ip addresses belong to
- a lan
- a vmachine (optional)
- an application (optional)
- a service (is subobject from application) (optional)

there is biz logic required
- when application,service,vmachine get's or modifies ip address -> make sure get's reflected in approriate lan
- when ip get's removed from lan -> check if ip is nowhere used, if used somewhere throw error
