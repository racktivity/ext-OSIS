
h2. Keep-alive from the box office environments

Every box office appliance sends a keep alive message once every minute to the Zenith datacenter.
If comp:cloudcenter_watchdogserver notices that a boxoffice environment is down an event will be triggered.
All events which are critical are being collected at comp:cloudcenter_eventmgmt_server
the comp:cloudcenter_eventmgmt_server will have required business logic to escalate to e.g. a ticketing system (comp:zenith_ticketingsystem)

h3. keep alive message

@include def:bo_keep_alive_message

h3. remarks

* cpu nodes do not do a keep alive to the def:cloudcenter or to the comp:bo_mgmt_appliance, each cpu/storage node has an agent communicating with an agentcontroller. This has a watchdog mecahnism as well.
